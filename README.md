The login feature has been implemented. User information is stored in SharePoint. Upon inputting the correct username and password,
the user clicks the Login button. If the username and password are valid (i.e., they exist in SharePoint), the user is successfully redirected to the homepage.
Conversely, if the username and password are invalid, the user is redirected to the registration page, where they can register. 
The validity of the login credentials is verified by three user IDs in SharePoint.

An AI chat interface was built using a custom GPT connector. When the user enters a message and clicks the Send button, the message is saved to a local collection (colChatHistory), and a response is retrieved from GPT via GPTConnector.ChatAPI. Both user and assistant messages are displayed in a scrollable gallery (Gallery8) using Label11. Messages are styled differently based on the sender to resemble a chat interface.

I built a dynamic cart display, showing items with quantities greater than zero, and added individual plus and minus buttons to easily adjust each item's quantity. 
I also included a cart summary, which displays the total quantity (showing "0 items" if empty) and the total price (displaying "$0.00" when empty). 
Finally, I implemented a "Clear Cart" button to reset all item quantities to zero.

Implemented the chat feature. On the searchBar, we can now search for people in the userbase and message them, even if we haven't texted them before. We can also search in the chats for specific texts, and the chats that contain those texts will be filtered and shown. Along with this, I also added a lot of other flagship messaging app features like showing how long ago the last message was sent and what the last message was. "you: " comes before every text that we've sent to make it easier to identify.
I also worked on events, designing the events ui, and all the backend such that events can be bookmarked and registered to. All the event impormation is shown consisely. 
I then worked on the community page, desgning the UI and structuring the backend to be able to show community posts and all relevant information. 
I then worked on the Create a post page, where we can create an event or a community post.
