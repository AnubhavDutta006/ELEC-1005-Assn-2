The login feature has been implemented. User information is stored in SharePoint. Upon inputting the correct username and password,
the user clicks the Login button. If the username and password are valid (i.e., they exist in SharePoint), the user is successfully redirected to the homepage.
Conversely, if the username and password are invalid, the user is redirected to the registration page, where they can register. 
The validity of the login credentials is verified by three user IDs in SharePoint.

An AI chat interface was built using a custom GPT connector. When the user enters a message and clicks the Send button, the message is saved to a local collection (colChatHistory), and a response is retrieved from GPT via GPTConnector.ChatAPI. Both user and assistant messages are displayed in a scrollable gallery (Gallery8) using Label11. Messages are styled differently based on the sender to resemble a chat interface.

The navigation across the pages has been developed and Power Automate for saving images and posts to sharepoint has been created. 
Users can now move across all pages and should soon be able to send posts in the community section of the App.

Developed the Gallery setting for bookmarking and worked on the posting functionality of the website. 
Able to bookmark and view information more efficiently. Can also view and post text, with images proving harder to give to Sharepoint.

I built a dynamic cart display, showing items with quantities greater than zero, and added individual plus and minus buttons to easily adjust each item's quantity. 
I also included a cart summary, which displays the total quantity (showing "0 items" if empty) and the total price (displaying "$0.00" when empty). 
Finally, I implemented a "Clear Cart" button to reset all item quantities to zero.
