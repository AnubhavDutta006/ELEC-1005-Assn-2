The login feature has been implemented. User information is stored in SharePoint. Upon inputting the correct username and password,
the user clicks the Login button. If the username and password are valid (i.e., they exist in SharePoint), the user is successfully redirected to the homepage.
Conversely, if the username and password are invalid, the user is redirected to the registration page, where they can register. 
The validity of the login credentials is verified by three user IDs in SharePoint.

The navigation across the pages has been developed and Power Automate for saving images and posts to sharepoint has been created. 
Users can now move across all pages and should soon be able to send posts in the community section of the App.
