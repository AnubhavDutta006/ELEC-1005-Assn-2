The login feature has been implemented. User information is stored in SharePoint. Upon inputting the correct username and password,
the user clicks the Login button. If the username and password are valid (i.e., they exist in SharePoint), the user is successfully redirected to the homepage.
Conversely, if the username and password are invalid, the user is redirected to the registration page, where they can register. 
The validity of the login credentials is verified by three user IDs in SharePoint.
